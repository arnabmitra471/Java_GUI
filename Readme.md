# Library management system
Today an effective library management is very important for an effective education system.Gone are the days when people have to travel physically to libraries to issue books \
Today many schools have online portals to buy books, like in my case as I have been a student of PIS and we have a portal [Shopforschool](https://www.shopforschool.in) where we can order  books and other stuff online.

Some of the libraries also have their own online website and people can just fill up a form and they can issue the books  that they need. In contrast if we go back in olden times when these systems were not avaivale to people then at that time for instance a person wanted to setup his own library then it was difficult to spread information about the library to various people to let them know that such a library exists. Hopefully there is no such problem today in most places. We will further work upon the GUI to improve it even more.


This is a GUI created for a library management system. It has various fields like `username`,`no of books`,`department` etc and a number of `java Swing` components are used. This GUI is craeted using java programming language

Currently we are working on this project.You can select your semester,department,book name from the list provided alongside.
There is a problem with the date of issue and we will fix it soon.
In java  if you want to import the swing package you have to write `import javax.swing.*`.
